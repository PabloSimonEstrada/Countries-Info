## How It Works

### Using the Application
Countries Info provides a straightforward and intuitive interface for users to explore information about countries worldwide. Here's how to use it:

- **Country Search:**
  - Upon opening the application, you'll find a text input field labeled "Enter country name."
  - Type the name of the country you're interested in and click the "Search Country" button.

- **Viewing Country Information:**
  - Once a valid country name is entered and the search is initiated, the application displays detailed information about the selected country, including a map showing the country's location using Google Maps.

### Error Handling
The application is designed to handle errors gracefully, ensuring a smooth user experience. Hereâ€™s how error handling is managed:

- **Invalid or Empty Input:**
  - If you attempt to search without entering a country name, an alert prompts you to enter a country name.

- **Backend Fetch Errors:**
  - If there's an issue fetching country information from the backend (like network issues or server errors), an error message is displayed alerting the user to try again.

- **No Match Found:**
  - In cases where a country name does not match any country in the API, the application does not display any information, indicating that the entered name might be incorrect or not available in the database.

- **Robust Exception Handling:**
  - The application uses try-catch blocks to handle exceptions during API requests, ensuring that any unforeseen errors are caught and handled appropriately.
